## Scripts

Hereâ€™s a list of available npm scripts:

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript code in the `src/` folder into JavaScript and places it in the `lib/` directory.
- **`npm run test`**: Runs the tests using Jest.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the code using ESLint.
- **`npm run lint:fix`**: Lints the code and automatically fixes issues where possible.
- **`npm run package`**: Bundles the project using `@vercel/ncc` and generates the output in the `dist/` folder.
- **`npm run build:package`**: Combines both the build and package steps.

## Testing

We use **Jest** for testing. You can run all the tests using:

```bash
npm run test
```

Make sure to add tests for any new features or changes. Test files are located in the _tests/ directory. Tests should follow the format *.test.js.
